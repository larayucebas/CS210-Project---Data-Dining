# CS210-Project---Data-Dining

Motivation:
This project aims to unravel the intricate dynamics of local businesses in Istanbul by analyzing their Google ratings. By delving into the correlations between ratings, location, and business types, I seek to uncover whether I went to places that has a Google rating of at least 4/5. Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors of EDA while preparing it.


Data Source:
Excel file that has been updated for the last 2 years (since I started university in Istanbul) by me.

Data Analysis Methods:
Gathering data on Istanbul's bars, restaurants, and cafes, I'll preprocess it, address missing values, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). Visualizing insights, I'll employ a machine learning model to predict Google ratings based on different features, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of rating influences.
